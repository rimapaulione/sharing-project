# Login - register form

<p> 
ðŸš§ Project in Progress ðŸš§
This application is built using Next.js 15 and the beta version of NextAuth.js 5. The primary goal is to create a community-driven platform where people can give and receive items for free within their own towns. It's all about reuse, reducing waste, and keeping valuable items out of landfills.

To achieve this, the project integrates Sharing-Project-Java with a real database and a Spring Boot REST API. It features a custom authentication flow with support for credentials-based login and Google authentication.

ðŸ”§ Key Features & Goals:
âœ… User-friendly experience for seamless sharing
âœ… Admin functionality for better platform management
âœ… Multi-language support for broader accessibility
âœ… Learning & experimenting with new technologies

This project is a work in progress, and I'm excited to keep improving it!
